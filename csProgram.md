# Overview

I have wanted to create some DnD tools for DMs. This is one section of
that project. I also wanted to get to know C# so that is the reason that
this section is written in C#.

A link to your YouTube demonstration. It is a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. (eventually)

# Development Environment

I used VScode for this project. It seemed like it would be a simple
environment for this program.

C# is an object-oriented language. It is primarily used in apps and games.

# Useful Websites

A list of websites that I found helpful in this project.

- [C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [C# Tutorial W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php)

# Future Work

A list of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.

- Read monsters from files rather than hard coded.
- Make a randomizer for specific challenge ratings.
